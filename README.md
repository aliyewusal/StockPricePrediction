# StockPricePrediction
*Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and deep learning algorithms Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have been used to predict Tesla Stock Price*


  After descriptive analysis, preprocessing and splitting of the data set, it is time to apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms to it. In this work, as predictive models, MLP, SVMs and LSTM were being used. Data has been scaled by using Standard Normal Distribution (SND) with the help of StandardScaler from sklearn library before fitting it into models. Then with training data sets models have been trained. After models are being trained their accuracy is measured.
	For the sake of simplicity, priority has been given to the way to keep as much default configuration as possible from Stickit-Learn and Keras Tensorflow libraries. During model creation for classification models standard scaler was used.
